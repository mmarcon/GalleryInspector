GalleryInspector

This simple PHP class was built to retrieve information about Galleries, Photos and Thumbnails from the DB created by Gallery 3.

This way one can use the Gallery UI to upload pictures on a website and this simple class to retrieve a JSON (or XML in the future) containing all the hierarchy of album and photos and render it however he likes. Doing that with the default REST API provided with Gallery 3 was kind of a pain and it was slow, so I thought I would write my own class that reads directly from the DB only the information that I actually need.
